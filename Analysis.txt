Run Time Analysis:
Task0: O(1)
Task 0 only performs a single print, which is independent of the input. Therefore the run
time is O(1).

Task1: O(N+M)
Task 1 needs to loop over the texts and calls list once, therefore the run time should be 
linear to the number of elements in "texts" (M) and "calls" (N)

Task2: O(N)
Task 2 loops over the calls and do a summation for every call in calls. The max function 
which finds the maximum of a value in an iterable also scale linearly.Therefore the run
 time is linearly dependent to the number of elements in "calls"

Task3: O(N long N)
Task 3 first loop over the calls list, therefore the run time scales as O(N). However, the 
dominating part is the sorting process which scales as O(N log N). Since N is large, there-
fore O(N) < O(N log N). In total, the runtime scales as O(N log N).

Tasks4: O(N log N)
Again, the sorting process which scales as O(N log N) should be dominating in run time. In 
the worst case, the number of telemakers should be the same as the number of calls. As a 
result, the run time scales as O(N log N).
